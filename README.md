# Project Summary
Pakodemy is a online platform that provides online tests, online trial, question solution videos, lecture videos, etc. to students preparing for LGS and YKS exams in our country. We are planning to develop this platform in partnership with its founder, in a way that students can access more questions for a monthly subscription fee, and by adding many different features that will contribute positively to their course work. By taking note of the features that can be added to the work and demo We started by developing an interface. The application interface you see here belongs to this demo.

# Lectures
As seen in the video, there are many different course options on the Courses page. Students will be able to choose the course they want from the course options on this page and solve the questions of this course from the publishing house they want. Although a certain subscription fee will have to be paid to use this feature, there are many problems rather than paying 100 lira for a test book. It will be more economical for all students to pay less for a platform. At the same time, students will be able to reinforce the topics by watching lecture videos on the courses page, and if they wish, they will be able to participate in online trials and see their rankings.


# Stats
Statistics page is a page where many important data that enables students to follow their status are displayed in graphs. On this page, students will be able to see many important data such as the number of questions they have solved daily, weekly, test nets, test sequences, question solution times. It will be much easier for them to follow.

# Forum
The forum page will be a place where students can consult each other on subjects such as study discipline, exam psychology, choosing a department, and at the same time throw questions that they cannot solve or cannot understand. In this way, it will be much easier for students to take their decisions and understand the questions they cannot solve.

# Friends
It can be very useful for students to go along with their friends during the study process by seeing their status. On the friends page of the application, you will be able to see how many questions your friends in your friend list have solved compared to yourself. At the same time, you will be able to add your friends to the groups you have established and compete with them by solving questions in real time.

# Groups
Thanks to the groups, you will be able to form groups with your own friends and see each other's test order on this group, the questions you have solved, and you will be able to help each other by throwing the questions that you could not solve in the group.

# My Profile
From the My Profile section, just like in many other applications, your profile photo, username, etc. You will be able to edit information, adjust application settings and see values such as your score. In addition, schools and teachers will be able to follow the status of their students much more closely by establishing groups.
